# sphinx-learning-path
A Sphinx extension to manage learning paths within a collection of documents.

## What is a learning pathway?

*Learning pathway is described as the chosen route taken by a learner through a range of (commonly) e-learning activities, which allows them to build knowledge progressively.* ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_pathway)

Software documentation doesn't usually read as a book or a manual, particularly in large projects where the reader is expected to navigate through hyperlinks and follow a non-linear path towards the information they need to understand.

## What does this extension do?

`sphinx-learning-path` uses manually generated table of contents describing learning pathways, and adds information to each document about the pathways it belongs to.
